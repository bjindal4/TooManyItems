# Too Many Items

## Description
Too Many Items is a game created in 48H during the Ludum Dare 26 (online game jam).

The original game has been frozen in the **ludum_dare** branch. Checkout this branch if you want to see the original and crappy code :) Master branch may still be updated in the future to improve the game.

This is a minimalist survivor game! 
Avoid the crazy old men trying to give you useless items and survive as long as you can. Use WASD or Arrows to move, and mouse click to fire.

Enjoy :)

## Notes
This game is powered by:
* **pixi.js**, a great Javascript 2D rendering engine
* **howler.js**, to play music and sounds easily

All the art has been created using Inkscape. Music and sounds created with LMMS (using predefined samples) and Audacity.
